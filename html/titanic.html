        <h2>Titanic Discovered</h2>
        <p>Sitting on the ocean floor after decades of being lost, the Titanic is split in half and blahhahahaahahahah.
          He sat on the floor of Room 23, now infinite, holding a small red object.
          Was it the button?
          A man approached—haggard, silent, eyes hollow. He looked familiar.
          “You can leave,” the man whispered, voice dry as paper. “But only if someone else presses it.”
          The button hummed faintly. Corin understood. It was his turn to wait.
          The door creaked open.
          A new guest stood there, dripping wet.
          The man smiled.
          “Come in. You must be tired from the storm.”
